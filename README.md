# Programming SSIS

A collection of helper class which allow to create SSIS packages programatically. This project demonstrates how SSIS packages can be generated with C# code only. 

# Background 
Especially because the SSIS interface is not very well documented by Microsoft, this project tries to give value insight and hints how to use the SSIS interface. Furthermore, there is a SSISCompomentWrap library which already encapsule the Integration Services interface and makes programming of own dtsx packages easier. See the example coding to understand how this library can be used.
